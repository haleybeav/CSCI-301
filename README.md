# Formal Languages and Functional Programming 

### Functional Programming Labs
* Computing pi with a series using functional programming : lab01.rkt :: lab01.pdf 
  
* Computing tangent, Euler's number, the Golden Ratio using continued fractions : lab02.rkt :: lab02.pdf
 
* Compares length of lists and returns the shorter with limited bulit-in function use : lab03.rkt :: lab03.pdf

* Composes two functions using two types of recursion, tail and repeated : lab04.rkt :: lab04.pdf
 
* Pig-Latin translator using limited utility functions and list processing : lab05.rkt :: lab05.pdf

* Converts numbers greater than or equal to 1000 to their 'word' counterpart using only list processing : lab06.rkt :: lab06-7.pdf
 
* Converts numbers less than 1000 to their 'word' form using list processing and combines with the previous lab to create a program that converts numbers through the sextillions to their 'word' form : lab07.rkt :: lab06-7.pdf
